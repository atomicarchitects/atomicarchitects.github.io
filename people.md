  <h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-ladera-84b18a171/" title="Hey friends, I'm Adriana, a graduate student in MIT's Computational Science and Engineering program! My research interests are numerical methods and algorithms, high-performance scientific computing, modeling and simulation, and computational geometry. With Tess, I'm interested in studying and creating novel molecular structures with the help of generative models and physics-informed insight (how I'm going to do that... I'll find out eventually). I completed my B.S. in computer science with a minor in physics at the University of South Florida, and am also a 2022 recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship! Outside of the lab (aka my computer), I enjoy playing piano, going out with friends, doing funky calisthenics, rock climbing, and creating meme art. I also have a fascination with eggs and egg-shaped things, so please send me a photo of those if you find any >:D">Adriana Ladera</a><br>SM Student</h3>
